These are all the resources I've accumulated and created when I was trying to learn german. After a lot of trial and error, finally understanding the grammar, and going to Germany, I sort of came to the conclusion that learning German as an American is to much of an effort to learn anymore.

I've really enjoyed learning it and I do understand a significant amount of the language. However, after going to Germany and trying to use it, I've learned that not only do most Germans know english better than I did german. My german definitely improved while I was there, but most germans feel like you practicing your german or making mistakes is not worth the hassle and they switch to english.

The real revelation to me was that it is truly impossible to become fluent in a language unless you explicitly are forced to see, read, hear, and speak it 100% of the time. I was able to converse with some germans that were willing to talk, but that was very few and far between. 

I still value the experience and it has taught me a lot about grammar and language systems. But I think it is time to throw in the towel for learning this unfortunately. 

It does make me sad to quit with this hobby as I've devoted a significant amount of time into it. But with many other things I've explored, this is the end of it for me here.
